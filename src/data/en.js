  'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nPraise be to Allah, the Wise, the All-Knowing,\nthe Omniscient, the All-Powerful.\nHe merges the night into the day, and the day into the night swiftly.\nAnd the sun and the moon and the stars are subjected by His command.\nBehold, His is the creation and the command.\nBlessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.\nThat is Allah, your Lord; there is no deity except Him.\nThe Creator of all things, so worship Him.\nAnd He is the Disposer of all affairs.\nHe revealed the Qur\'an as a mercy for the creation\nand for the betterment of their conditions.\nA Book whose verses are perfected and then explained in detail by One who is Wise and All-Aware.\nIndeed, this Qur\'an guides to that which is most upright\nand gives glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds, that they will have a great reward.\nI bear witness that there is no deity except Allah,\nnone is rightfully worshipped except Him.\nAnd I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger.\nIt is from Allahâ€™s kindness to people that He sent Muhammad\npeace be upon him,\ncalling people to what benefits them\nand bringing down upon them His mercy,\nas Allah said,\nAnd My mercy encompasses all things.\nSo I will decree it for those who fear Me and give zakat and those who believe in Our signs,\nthose who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet,\nwhom they find written in the Torah and the Gospel,\nhe commands them what is right and forbids them what is wrong,\nand makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the impure things,\nand relieves them of their burden and the shackles that were upon them.\nSo those who believe in him and honor him and support him and follow the light which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.\nSay, "O people, I am the Messenger of Allah to you all,\nto Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.\nThere is no deity except Him. He gives life and causes death."\nSo believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him so that you may be guided.\nSo may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him, his family, his companions, and his followers.\nAs for what follows:\nO people, fear your Lord and be conscious of a Day when no parent will avail their child,\nnor will a child avail their parent at all.\nIndeed, the promise of Allah is true.\nSo do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Deceiver deceive you about Allah.\nFor those who are pious, a good end \nand certain victory in this world and the Hereafter are assured.\nAllah said:\nAnd Allah will save those who feared Him by their attainment; no evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.\n"And whoever fears Allah, He will make a way for him\n"\nand provide for him from where he does not expect.\nAnd whoever relies upon Allah, then He is sufficient for him.\nAnd whoever fears Allah, He will make for him of his matter ease.\nAnd whoever fears Allah, He will remove his misdeeds from him and make great his reward.\nAnd indeed, part of the obligatory piety towards Allah is for a servant to devote their worship solely to their Lord,\nnot directing any act of worship to anyone other than Him, glorified and exalted.\nAs He said:\nJudgment belongs to none but Allah.\nHe commands that you worship none but Him.\nThat is the correct religion, but most people do not know.\nO people, worship your Lord who created you and those before you, so that you may become righteous.\nThis is the meaning of the testimony of monotheism,\nThere is no deity except Allah,\nwhich is the symbol of Islam\nand the reason for salvation.\nAllah said:\nAnd your God is one God; there is no deity except Him, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.\nHe forms you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.\nAnd the testimony of monotheism is complemented by the testimony of the message,\nthat Muhammad is truly the Messenger of Allah.\nAs Allah said:\n"Muhammad is not the father of any one of your men,\n"\nbut he is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets.\nAnd Allah is aware of all things.\nThese two testimonies are the first pillar of Islam.\nAmong the pillars of Islam is also the establishment of the five daily prayers,\nas Allah said:\nAnd establish prayer; indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing,\nand the remembrance of Allah is greater,\nand Allah knows that which you do.\nAnd giving zakat, as in His saying:\nTake from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke blessings upon them.\n"Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them,\n"\nand Allah is Hearing, Knowing.\nAnd fasting during the month of Ramadan, as Allah said:\nThe month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur\'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion.\nSo whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast it.\nAnd performing the pilgrimage to the House for those who are able to find a way to it.\nHe said:\nAnd proclaim to the people the Hajj; they will come to you on foot\nand on every lean camel; they will come from every distant pass\nthat they may witness benefits for themselves.\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said:\nIslam is to testify that there is no deity except Allah,\nand that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,\nto establish prayer,\nto give zakat,\nto fast Ramadan,\nand to perform Hajj to the House if you are able to do so.\nAnd faith is to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers,\nthe Last Day, and to believe in predestination, its good and its bad.\nAnd excellence (Ihsan) is to worship Allah as if you see Him,\nand if you do not see Him, He indeed sees you.\nO believers,\nthis is the religion of Allah and His law which He has chosen for the creation,\nand through which He has shown them mercy by bringing them goodness and benefits\nand averting from them evil and corruption.\nThus, it was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, on the day of Arafah:\nToday I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion.\nAnd Allah described His Prophet, peace be upon him, by saying:\nAnd We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.\nFrom these clear principles,\nthe blessed Sharia came to secure benefits and increase them,\nand to avert corruption or minimize it.\nIt established that averting corruption takes precedence over securing benefits,\nas well as achieving the highest benefits even if it means foregoing the lowest ones,\nand committing the lesser of two evils to avert the greater one.\nSo, in cases of conflict, the higher benefit is chosen and the lesser evil is committed.\nAdditionally, the Sharia affirmed that harm should be removed without causing harm,\nas stated in the hadith:\nThere should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.\nThus, harm is to be avoided as much as possible.\nFrom this perspective, the Sharia encompasses everything that leads to the flourishing of life\nand the achievement of development,\nand it prohibited causing harm to others\nor inflicting injury upon them.\nIt commanded justice,\nnoble morals, kindness to parents,\nmaintaining family ties, truthfulness in speech,\npreserving rights and delivering them to their rightful owners,\nfulfilling trusts, and honoring contracts and covenants,\nand obedience to those in authority.\nAllah said:\nAllah commands justice, good conduct, and giving to relatives,\nand forbids immorality, bad conduct, and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded.\nAnd fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have taken it, and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made Allah a witness over you.\nIndeed, Allah knows what you do.\nIndeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due\nand when you judge between people to judge with justice.\nExcellent is that which Allah instructs you..\nIndeed, Allah is ever Hearing and Seeing\nO you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you.\nAnd if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day.\nThat is the best [way] and best in result.\nThe wise Lawgiver has emphasized the necessity of preserving the five essentials,\nwhich all divine laws have agreed to care for:\nthe preservation of religion, life, intellect, wealth, and honor.\nThe Sharia considers the violation of these essentials a crime warranting punishment.\nThus, safeguarding these essentials is one of the reasons for entering Paradise and earning the pleasure of the Most Merciful,\nand one of the reasons for stability, happiness, progress, and civilization in this world.\nWithout them, life becomes disordered, and neglecting them leads to punishment in the Hereafter.\nHence, from the Prophet\'s sermon during the Hajj:\nYour blood, your wealth, and your honor are sacred to you like the sanctity of this day in this city in this month.\nReligion is a necessity because a person cannot do without obeying their Lord and worshiping Him, for which they were created.\nAllah said:\nAnd I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\nSay, "My Lord has commanded justice and that you maintain yourselves [in worship] of Him at every place or time of prostration, and invoke Him, sincere to Him in religion."\nJust as He originated you, you will return.\nAnd We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], "Worship Allah and avoid Taghut."\nAnd among them were those whom Allah guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed.\nSo proceed through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.\nAnd Allah said, affirming the necessity of preserving life and prohibiting the taking of innocent lives:\nAnd do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right.\nAnd do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful.\nAnd whoever does that in aggression and injustice - then We will drive him into a Fire. And that, for Allah, is [always] easy.\nSimilarly, Allah affirmed the necessity of preserving wealth:\nO you who have believed, do not consume one another\'s wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know [it is unlawful].\nRegarding the necessity of preserving intellect, Allah said:\nO you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan,\nso avoid it that you may be successful.\nSatan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?\nAnd the texts of the Qur\'an and Sunnah prohibit violating people\'s honor:\nAllah said:\nAnd those who harm believing men and believing women for [something] other than what they have earned have certainly born upon themselves a slander and manifest sin.\nAnd He, the Exalted, said:\nIndeed, those who [falsely] accuse chaste, unaware, and believing women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and they will have a great punishment.\nAnd the Almighty said:\nO you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them.\nNor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them.\nAnd do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames.\nWretched is the name of disobedience after [one\'s] faith. And whoever does not repent - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.\nO you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin.\nAnd do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it. \nAnd fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of repentance and Merciful.\nAnd complementing this is the principle that means are judged according to their ends,\nand that what is necessary to complete an obligatory act becomes itself obligatory,\nand that which cannot be completed except by fulfilling the obligation is also obligatory.\nTherefore, any means that lead to preserving the objectives of Sharia are commanded by it.\nSince essential objectives and benefits cannot be achieved except through means and paths leading to them,\ntheir means and paths follow the same rulings as their ends.\nThus, every believer must strive to preserve the five essentials,\nleading to the safety of the people, stability of life,\nthe spread of security,\nand enabling people to achieve their religious and worldly interests.\nHe must also cooperate with others in this out of devotion to Allah,\nand seeking His reward in the Hereafter.\nEvery Muslim must prevent those who try to tamper with the Shariaâ€™s objectives in preserving these essentials.\nWe all have a responsibility, according to our tasks, work, and positions, towards this.\nWe must all raise the souls, especially the young ones, to respect these essentials.\nWhile preserving these five essentials is obligatory at all times and places,\nits obligation is even more emphasized in these noble places,\nas Allah said:\nAnd whoever intends a deed therein of deviation [in religion] or wrongdoing - We will make him taste of a painful punishment.\nIn Hajj, there is a display of the ritual and sincerity in worshiping Allah.\nIt is not a place for political slogans or partisanship,\npartisanship that requires adhering to the regulations and instructions that ensure pilgrims perform their rituals\nin security and tranquility.\nPilgrims of the Sacred House of Allah:\nYou are in Arafat, in a great stance where Allah boasts of you to His angels.\nThis is an honorable place and a virtuous time,\nwhere good deeds are multiplied, sins are forgiven,\nand ranks are elevated.\nShow Allah your adherence to the Sunnah,\nand follow the example of the noble Prophet, peace be upon him, who gave a sermon in this place,\nthen instructed Bilal to call the Adhan and Iqama, and he prayed Dhuhr two rak\'ahs.\nThen Bilal called the Iqama, and the Prophet, peace be upon him, prayed Asr two rak\'ahs combined and shortened.\nHe then stood on his camel, remembering Allah and supplicating to Him until the sun set.\nHe then went to Muzdalifah, advising his companions to be calm, dignified, and gentle.\nIn Muzdalifah, he prayed Maghrib three rak\'ahs,\nand Isha two rak\'ahs,\nand stayed there until he prayed Fajr.\nThen he continued to supplicate until the light of dawn was clear.\nHe then went to Mina and threw seven pebbles at Jamrat al-Aqabah, sacrificed his offering, and shaved his head.\nThen he circumambulated the House (performed Tawaf al-Ifadah),\nthen returned to Mina, and stayed there during the days of Tashreeq, frequently remembering Allah with Takbeer, praise, and Tahleel.\nHe threw the three Jamarat after the decline of the sun each day,\nsupplicating after the first and second.\nHe permitted those with excuses to not stay overnight in Mina.\nThe Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, is to remain in Mina until the thirteenth day, which is preferable,\nalthough he allowed haste on the twelfth day.\nWhen he completed his Hajj and intended to travel, he performed Tawaf around the Kaaba.\nPilgrims of the Sacred House of Allah:\nThe Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, stood in Arafat fasting to aid him in remembrance and supplication,\nand he spent his time in Arafat remembering Allah and supplicating to Him, so follow his example, peace be upon him.\nCall upon your Lord with humility and in private; indeed, He does not like transgressors.\nAnd call upon Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good.\nPray to Allah for yourselves, for your parents, and for those who are connected to you.\nFor whoever prays for his brother in his absence, the angel appointed to him says, "Ameen, and for you the same."\nAnd pray for our brothers in Palestine who are afflicted by suffering and harmed by their enemy, shedding blood,\nand causing corruption in the land,\nand preventing them from accessing their needs of food, medicine, nourishment, and clothing.\nAnd the most deserving of your prayers are those who have done good deeds,\nand acts of kindness\nincluding those who serve the Two Holy Mosques\nand strive to ensure the comfort of the guests of the Most Merciful,\nforemost among them the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, and his Crown Prince.\nO Allah, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer,\nO Possessor of majesty and honor, we ask You by Your grace and benevolence to grant success to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz,\nand his Crown Prince, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in all that is good.\nO Allah, be their supporter and helper.\nO Allah, reward them with the best reward for the great efforts they have made and continue to make for Islam and Muslims.\nO Allah, magnify their reward, increase their good deeds, and be pleased with them.\nO Allah, accept the Hajj of the pilgrims.\nAnd ease their affairs, and return them to their countries safe and enriched, with their sins forgiven,\ntheir repentance accepted, and their needs fulfilled.\nO Allah, forgive the Muslim men and women, the believing men and women,\nand protect them from all evil.\nPreserve for them their religion, their security, their lives, their wealth,\ntheir intellect, and their honor.\nBring them benefits and goodness,\nand ward off from them evil and misdeeds.\nO Allah, rectify their hearts,\ngrant them security in their homelands,\nsatisfy their hunger,\nbless them in their provisions,\nand take care of all their affairs.\nGlory be to your Lord, the Lord of Might, above what they describe,\nand peace be upon the messengers,\nand praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.';
